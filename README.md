A: Stack Overflow: Escape Edition.

	•	Q: How do you comfort a JavaScript bug?
A: You console.log it until it stops crying.

	•	Q: What do you call a codebase that interviews well but doesn’t work?

A: A resume-driven development masterpiece.


Features
	
    •	🧠 Memory-leaking trivia for tech interviews
	
    •	💡 “Smart” answers with dumb humor
	
    •	🤖 AI-generated punchlines for any question
	
    •	📈 Boost your confidence, not your competence

How to Use
	
    1.	Clone the repository (or pretend you did).

    4.	Win the interview by sheer absurdity.

Coming Soon
